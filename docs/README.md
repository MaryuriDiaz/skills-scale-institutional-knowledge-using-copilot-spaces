## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme uses an iterative, stakeholder-aligned, and outcome-focused project management approach that emphasizes:

- **Clear project lifecycles:** Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, Review
- **Well-defined roles:** Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, Stakeholder
- **Documentation & artefacts:** One-pagers, release plans, backlogs, risk registers, and retrospectives
- **Communication & escalation:** Structured paths for effective risk and issue management

This system is designed to ensure clarity, accountability, and continuous improvement, supporting efficient project delivery and strong collaboration.
